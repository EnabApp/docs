## Introduction
App.vue has all necessary information and configuration for your app in your playground. This file should has the following structure:
```html
<template>
  <!-- Application -->
  <div p="4">
    <span un-text="white">Hello</span>
    <UiButton @click="app.toggleRunning()">Exit App</UiButton>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const props = defineProps({
  app: {
    type: Object,
    required: true,
  },
});
</script>
```

More configuration and information can be found at [`App Model`{color="error"}](https://docs.enab.app/core/models/app)
