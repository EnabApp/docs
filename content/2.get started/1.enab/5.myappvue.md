## Prepare your App
Few steps before getting into coding your first application. We have to choose suitable name for our application and changing some files. Let's start with changing the name of our application. We have to change the name of our application in the following files:
1. `playground/app.vue` in `name` property as it would be our folder name:
```html{14-15}
  <template>
  <NuxtLayout>
    <NuxtLoadingIndicator />
    <NuxtPage />
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>
<!---->
<script setup>
  import { useAppManager } from '#imports'

  const appManager = useAppManager()
  // App Configuration
  appManager.addApp({
      "name": "RestaurantManagement",
      "title": "Ø¥Ø¯Ø§Ø±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø·Ø§Ø¹Ù…",
      "minWidth": 400,
      "minHeight": 300,
  })
</script>
```
2. Change folder name of your application which it would be in `/src/components/Enab/` to your application component name `/src/components/RestaurantManagement/`{color="warning"}.
3. Choosing suitable icon for our application. Let's go to [`Icones`{color="info"}](https://icones.js.org){target="_blank"} and choose suitable icon for our application. Then copy the SVG code and paste it in `Icon.vue` file. inside `template` tag.
```html
<!---->
<template>
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-home">
    <path d="M3 9l9-7 9 7v11a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2z"></path>
    <polyline points="9 22 9 12 15 12 15 22"></polyline>
  </svg>
</template>
```
:MiniCard{color="error" title="ðŸ’¡ Do not add width or height to your svg so you can change it easily."}


## Start Coding
Go to `src/components/RestaurantManagement/App.vue` and start coding your application. You can use any component from `Ui`{color="success"}.

Getters and actions can be found at [`App Model`{color="error"}](https://docs.enab.app/core/models/app)
