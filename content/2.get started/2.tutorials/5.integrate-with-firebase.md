# Introduction
In this tutorial we are going to connect our app with our Firebase.

1. Install Firebase SDK and VueUse Firebase
    ```bash
        yarn add firebase @vueuse/firebase
    ```

2. Register your Firebase project:

```js
// Import necessary libraries
import { ref, computed } from '#imports'
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app'
import { collection, doc, getFirestore, limit, orderBy, query } from 'firebase/firestore'
import { useFirestore } from '@vueuse/firebase/useFirestore'

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp({ projectId: 'enab-da3a5' })
const db = getFirestore(app)

// Access a collection reference
const todos = useFirestore(collection(db, 'todos'))
console.log(todos)
```

You can define your Firebase object in a store so you can access it from anywhere in your app.
