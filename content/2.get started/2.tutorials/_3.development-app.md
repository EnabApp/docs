## Instructions
1. Make new app component at `playground/components`. E.g. `playground/components/TestApp.vue`. Be sure it has the basic structure as below:
  ```html
    <template>
      <Transition>
        <UiDesktopWindow v-if="app.running" v-show="!app.minimized" :app="app">
          Hello
        </UiDesktopWindow>
      </Transition>
    </template>
    
    <script setup>
        const props = defineProps({ app: Object });
    </script>
  ```
1. Register your app inside `playground/app.vue` using the code below:
```js
import { useAppManager } from '#imports';
const appManager = useAppManager()
const myApp = {
  "name": "TestApp",
  "title": "my test app",
  "icon": "i-ri-todo-fill", // icon name from https://icones.js.org
  "size": "min-w-lg min-h-2xl max-w-lg max-h-2xl",
}
appManager.addApp(myApp)
```

## Note
Development app will not be published with your package. It is only for development purpose.
