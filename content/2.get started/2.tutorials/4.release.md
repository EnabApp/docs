# Introduction
This script allows you to release your app automatically to NPM. It will automatically create a new release and upload it to NPM through GitHub.

This script already built in [`module-starter`{color="warning"}](https://github.com/EnabApp/module-starter){target="_blank"} template

## Creating Folders and Files

1. Create folder `scripts` and create `release.ts` file in it then paste the following code in it:
:TextDownload{url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnabApp/core/master/scripts/release.ts"}

2. Create folder `.github` and create `workflows` folder in it and create `release.yml` file in it then paste the following code in it:
:TextDownload{url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnabApp/core/master/.github/workflows/release.yml"}

3. Structure will looks like this:
    ```md
      ├── scripts/
      │   └── release.ts
      └── .github/
          └── workflows/
              └── release.yml
    ```
4. In `package.json` file add the following line in `script`:
    ```json {6}
    "scripts": {
        "prepack": "nuxt-module-build",
        "dev": "nuxi dev playground",
        "dev:build": "nuxi build playground",
        "dev:prepare": "nuxt-module-build --stub && nuxi prepare playground",
        "release": "cd scripts && node --loader ts-node/esm release.ts"
    },
    ```

    2. Click on `New repository secret`.
    3. Your secret name **MUST** be `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` and paste your NPM token inside `value`.

## How to use Automatic Release

1. Run the following commands:
:ProseCommand{language="yarn" commands="yarn add ts-node|yarn add fs-extra|yarn add bumpp -g"}


2. When you need to release run the following command:
:ProseCommand{language="yarn" commands="yarn release"}

3. You can see the output of the command would look like this:
    ```bash {5}
      Current version 1.8.5-beta.20 »
                major 2.0.0
                minor 1.9.0
                patch 1.8.5
    >         next 1.8.5-beta.21
            pre-patch 1.8.6-beta.0
            pre-minor 1.9.0-beta.0
            pre-major 2.0.0-beta.0
              as-is 1.8.5-beta.20
              custom ...
